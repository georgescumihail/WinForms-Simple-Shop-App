# Winforms Simple Shop App

This is my year 2 project for the "Windows Applications Programming" class.

 - You can choose different entries from a dropdown menu that will be displayed in the shopping cart, enter your data (you will be assigned a random ID), place orders that will be displayed in the final window, serialize and serialize to binary file, save orders to text file, and the invoices will be automatically stored in a MS Access database.
 - The purpose of the project was just to learn how to create a simple WinForms app.
